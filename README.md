## Running the Application

To run the application correctly, follow these steps:

1. **Set .env file path to your IPv4 address:**
   - Find your IPv4 address using the command:
     ```
     ipconfig
     ```
   - Update the path in the .env file accordingly.

2. **Start the backend:**
   - Ensure the backend is running on your computer with:
     ```
     npm run start:dev
     ```

3. **Start the frontend application:**
   - Run the frontend application with:
     ```
     npx expo start
     ```

4. **Connect via Expo app:**
   - Once the app is running, use the Expo app on your phone to scan the QR code displayed in the console.

## Issues with Testing

I encountered problems with testing. While I have knowledge of the subject and researched extensively to resolve these issues, I was unable to fix them due to the differences in working with React Native compared to React.

I would appreciate the opportunity to review the code together and discuss potential improvements.
